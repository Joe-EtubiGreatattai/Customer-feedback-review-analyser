I know this is hard to tell, because I've had my original pads for so long they fell apart at the seams. But after some cursing and a struggle to put these on, my headphones actually sounded better. I had to turn my volume down from 22 (which I usually keep it at) to 18. So that tells me these have good noise cancelling, at least.\n\nIs a tight fit a bad thing or a good thing? They might not come off so easily which is great. I don't think I'll have a good time taking these off to clean them, so keep that in mind. Anyway, I'm happy that they sound better than my old raggedy Corsair ones."
