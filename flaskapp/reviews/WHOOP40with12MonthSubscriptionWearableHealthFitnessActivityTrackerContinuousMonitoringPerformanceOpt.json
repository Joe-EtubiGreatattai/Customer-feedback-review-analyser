I dont care there is no watch face which alot of people care about. I am not interested in a watch. The ONLY con is the cheap plastic U piece that folds over and holds the band in place. WHY? It has come undone and nearly broke a few times. I HATE that. There is no reason for it to be SO flimsy on an otherwise outstanding piece of technology! I am worried I will snap it or break it at some point accidentally. Even snapping on the charger got a little difficult because it was slightly bent out of shape, which makes it fall out the hinge/holes. Otherwise, it would be 5 stars!"

Unclear if it's the fault of Whoop or the phone manufacturers, but seems like the latter, since some DO work (Pixel 7 reportedly is fine, as are Galaxy devices).\n\nThat aside the HR accuracy seemed very questionable for me - at times reading too high, when compared to my running watch and HR strap I use with treadmill. So based on both of these issues I returned it."

It\u2019s one a time fee and provides identical statistics, minus the subscription. Whoop has a ways to go before they can justify a yearly fee of $240"

I\u2019ve sent countless messages to them via live chat and been told it\u2019s being dealt with, heard nothing yet. I\u2019ll update as soon as I do."
