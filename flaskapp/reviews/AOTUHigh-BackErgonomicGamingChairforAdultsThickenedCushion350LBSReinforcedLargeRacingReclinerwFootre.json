    "text": "The best gaming chair\n\nThis chair definitely meets and exceed my expectation. Long story short, it is the best gaming chair. If you are looking for a gaming chair under $500, Buy it, enjoy it and you save $200+.\n\nI did quite a lot researches and then made the decision on this chair. I used couple of chairs under $200 dollar these 2 years, unfortunately none of them worked well. The design and curve of the back hurt my back during long hours sit. They are flimsy and after 2-3 month I feel they are crashed and start to make lots of noise that make me nervous when sitting on it. I planned to buy a brand chair like Razer to replace those terrible best-selling 100dollar chair on amazon, even Razer cost more then $500. But I was disappointed after tried the Iskur at my local store. The seat and back cushion are too much firm and not comfy at all. The lumbar support of Iskur is adjustable, but unfortunately, I never find a good position to fit my back. So I would say this AOTU gaming chair is the most comfortable one even compare with famous brand chair. It seems like a risky choice as this chair don\u2019t have too much reviews and rating records. But I am happy with this chair as it works very well.\n\nI took about 20 minutes to put this chair together. When it arrived, I was surprised the package is super big and heavy. From the package it claims more than 60lbs, and it is. Another evidence this is solidly built high quality chair. There is a large piece of instruction sheets show the components and assembling steps. It is easy and straight forward to follow.\n\nOverall the chair provides me great supports, and I never feel sore or pain on this chair. I am 6\u20192\u201d and 230lbs. This chair fitting me well. My son and wife enjoy sitting on it as well. So I would say this chair fits most people under 6\u20192\u201d.\n\nThe curve of back is just perfectly to fit me, the foam lumbar support is in a much bigger size compare the previous chair I used. That make my back is fully supported.\n\nThe seating experience is impressive and the seat cushion satisfy me the most. It said it is a hybrid design with spring inside, I am not the expert but I feel it give me the similar feel as my sofa, soft but supportive. I don\u2019t feel pain or sore after 2 hours meeting or game. Very comfort help me focus on my work. The leather is perforated keep me always cool during long sitting.\n\nI like the leather they are using. It is solid, and the texture is like as some luxury car\u2019s interior leather. it really gives me great touch and feel experience. I hope it can last long. The fabric cover of neck and lumbar pillow is soft and cozy.\nThe base of this char is made by metal, I believe it is much stronger and more durable compare with other gaming chair that with plastic base.\n\nOh, don\u2019t forget it has a footrest. The quality is good and it performs well. Actually, I don\u2019t think the footrest is necessary when buying it. But now I use it quite a lot every day. When I am in a boring remote meeting or waiting my laptop running the report, I can recline the back, pull out the footrest, then I will have a short, quick, and perfect recovering.\nThe other functions are doing well like rocking, tilt adjustment, lock the back angel in any position, smoothly wheels, etc. I like this chair. It is not only a gaming chair but the most comfortable chair for me to work from home. I will keep update my findings. I am happy with its performance so far and recommend it to others."

    "text": "Overall I like this chair. Wish people would not give reviews within minutes of first using items. Use them for a month or so first before you review.\n\nWith that said, this is a heavy duty and heavy, (about 65lbs), chair. It is comfortable, very adjustable and nice to sit in.\n\nI'm 6'2\" and weigh 220lbs. I play Star Citizen for hours at a time. What has happened is the seat cushion now collapses to the frame quickly. I have resorted to sitting on a My Pillow which helps a lot.\nThe lumbar pad is to thin IMHO and could be a couple inches deeper. Also it should come with some way to attach to the seat back. I tried command strips, but they only worked for a little while. The pillow now keeps the pad in place...\n\nOverall I'm pleased..."

    "text": "When looking for my new chair I based my choice on the thickness of the seat. As someone who has owned a few different gaming chairs, I can tell you without a doubt the most important factor is the thickness of the seat cushion. My last chair, a GT Racer, was like sitting on a bare metal bench after just a few weeks of use. Don't make that mistake. I've never owned one of the more expensive $500+ chairs so I can't vouch for a comparison to those, but I can say that there is no reason to spend that much if comfort is your primary objective. This AOTU chair the most comfortable \"gaming\" chair I have owned. I cannot yet speak for it's longevity, only having been using it for a couple of weeks, but for now, I am extremely happy with having chosen this chair. I recommend it, your butt will thank you for it."

    "text": "Started working from home in the last 6 months and with very little exception I am in this chair 8-10 hrs a day, 5 days a week - only getting up for restroom breaks or to eat. No pinching, no back aches - it's honestly the most comfortable seating in my house, which makes me mad when I think of what I paid for my couch! LOL.\nI would highly recommend this chair, not matter the use, but especially for those that will be seating for long, consecutive hours of constant sitting!"
